#Extremely crude continuous wavelet transform

A few years ago, I tried to get this to work with my EEG data. I kind of got it to work, but I never ended up figuring out the scale-frequency relationship properly. It would have been nice having a low-tech time-frequency display with linear frequency scaling and arbitrary frequency resolution.
Anway, it doesn't use any external libraries, and works in Octave as well.
